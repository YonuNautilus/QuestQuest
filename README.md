"QuestQuest"

This is my first coding project, made by following this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dzhgsVaiSo
Just to share a small gripe about the video series:
The guy is adament that this is NOT a beginner's tutorial. Yet building a game from the ground up was perfect for me as a beginner, as I got to play with the code and see how it works hands-on.
As I grew more confortable, I made more and more changes to make this more 'my own,' though I cannot deny that this tutorial is the base of this project.

Art and music are done by me but not totally original. They are based on sprites from other games (characters based on pokemon trainer sprites etc).
Music is all covers.

Sound effects simply made using Audacity.

I doubt I will come back to this, but it is fun to look back on old projects!
