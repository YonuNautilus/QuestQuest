Alpha 0.1.2
	Jul 31, 2016
	Major Engine Rework:
		-Streamlined level/levelState and entities system
			-Each level still has own levelXClass, but all extend from a central level class that extends from the GameState class
			-common methods/objects/variables (not sure of correct terminology) are created [initialized?] in the main level class, then are defined in the level subclasses (music name and directory, arraylist of entities, also update, init, control and event methods).
			-similar changes to MapObject and subclasses
		-made minor visual changes to sprites so hitboxes fit the sprite appropriately
			-new temporary sprite for Slugger so player can hit enemies with gun (with new hitbox fix, hitting with bullets was impossible)
	What's next:
		-Dialogue (little speech tutorial, similar to talking boxes in Yoshi's Island)
		-Score and points system
		-More music
		-New Slugger sprite
		-New enemies and enemy behavior
		-Particle effects for enemies
		-Changelog Menu option, brings to screen that reads and displays changelog file(s)
	Far Future plans:
		-Weapons system
		-Mouse-controlled shooting
		-Shooting enemies (rotating/auto-aiming laser turret?)
